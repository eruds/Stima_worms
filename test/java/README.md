Install the Java SE Development Kit 8 for your environment here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Make sure JAVA_HOME system variable is set, Windows 10 tutorial here: https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-on-windows-10/

Install IntelliJ IDEA here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
The community edition is free.

## Building

Make your modifications to the starter bot using IntelliJ. Once you are happy with your changes, package your bot by opening up the "Maven Projects" tab on the right side of the screen. From here go to the  "java-sample-bot" > "Lifecycle" group and double-click "Install"
This  will create a .jar file in the folder called "target". The file will be called "java-sample-bot-jar-with-dependencies.jar".

## Running 

To run the bot, copy the file "java-sample-bot-jar-with-dependencies.jar" to a different location. Then go to the starter-pack and edit the config.json file accordingly.
Then run the "run.bat" file on windows or the "run.sh" file for unix.
